 *  The shardKey part of the key represent the shardId where it was first created. An object with this
 *  primary key can later on be moved to another shard without being altered. The reason for having
 *  the origin shardKey as part of the key, is that the server will not need to check uniqueness constraint
 *  across all shards on every insert. Updates / moves across shards are already controlled by the server
 *  in the sense that the objects needs to be there already - we only need this part for inserts.
