/** Verifies that given primary key is valid.
 * The reason we narrow validity for valid keys are twofold:
 *  1: Make sure to only support types that can be used as an object index in DBKeyMutationSet.
 *     For example, ArrayBuffer cannot be used (gives "object ArrayBuffer") but Uint8Array can be
 *     used (gives comma-delimited list of included bytes).
 *  2: Avoid using plain numbers and Dates as keys when they are synced, as they are not globally unique.
 *  3: Since we store the key as a VARCHAR server side in current version, try not promote types that stringifies to become very long server side.
 *
 * @param id
